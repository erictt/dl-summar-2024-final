> **Note:** We have not adapted the following scripts of Hugging Face Transformers:

This folder contains several scripts that showcase how to fine-tune a ðŸ¤— Transformers model on a question answering dataset,
like SQuAD.

## Trainer-based scripts

The [`run_qa.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/question-answering/run_qa.py),
[`run_qa_beam_search.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/question-answering/run_qa_beam_search.py) and [`run_seq2seq_qa.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/question-answering/run_seq2seq_qa.py) leverage the ðŸ¤— [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/trainer.html) for fine-tuning.

### Fine-tuning BERT on SQuAD1.0

The [`run_qa.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/question-answering/run_qa.py) script
allows to fine-tune any model from our [hub](https://huggingface.co/models) (as long as its architecture has a `ForQuestionAnswering` version in the library) on a question-answering dataset (such as SQuAD, or any other QA dataset available in the `datasets` library, or your own csv/jsonlines files) as long as they are structured the same way as SQuAD. You might need to tweak the data processing inside the script if your data is structured differently.

**Note:** This script only works with models that have a fast tokenizer (backed by the ðŸ¤— Tokenizers library) as it
uses special features of those tokenizers. You can check if your favorite model has a fast tokenizer in
[this table](https://huggingface.co/transformers/index.html#supported-frameworks), if it doesn't you can still use the old version of the script which can be found [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/legacy/question-answering).

Note that if your dataset contains samples with no possible answers (like SQuAD version 2), you need to pass along the flag `--version_2_with_negative`.

This example code fine-tunes BERT on the SQuAD1.0 dataset. It runs in 24 min (with BERT-base) or 68 min (with BERT-large)
on a single tesla V100 16GB.

```bash
python run_qa.py \
  --model_name_or_path bert-base-uncased \
  --dataset_name squad \
  --do_train \
  --do_eval \
  --per_device_train_batch_size 12 \
  --learning_rate 3e-5 \
  --num_train_epochs 2 \
  --max_seq_length 384 \
  --doc_stride 128 \
  --output_dir /tmp/debug_squad/ \
  --train_adapter \
  --adapter_config seq_bn \
  --overwrite_output_dir
```

Training with the previously defined hyper-parameters yields the following results:

```bash
f1 = 88.52
exact_match = 81.22
```

### Fine-tuning T5 on SQuAD2.0

The [`run_seq2seq_qa.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/question-answering/run_seq2seq_qa.py) script is meant for encoder-decoder (also called seq2seq) Transformer models, such as T5 or BART. These
models are generative, rather than discriminative. This means that they learn to generate the correct answer, rather than predicting the start and end position of the tokens of the answer.

This example code fine-tunes T5 on the SQuAD2.0 dataset.

```bash
python run_seq2seq_qa.py \
  --model_name_or_path t5-small \
  --dataset_name squad_v2 \
  --context_column context \
  --question_column question \
  --answer_column answers \
  --do_train \
  --do_eval \
  --per_device_train_batch_size 12 \
  --learning_rate 3e-5 \
  --num_train_epochs 2 \
  --max_seq_length 384 \
  --doc_stride 128 \
  --output_dir /tmp/debug_seq2seq_squad/ \
  --train_adapter \
  --adapter_config seq_bn \
  --overwrite_output_dir
```

### RoBERTa/BERT/DistilBERT and masked language modeling

The following example fine-tunes RoBERTa on WikiText-2. Here too, we're using the raw WikiText-2. The loss is different
as BERT/RoBERTa have a bidirectional mechanism; we're therefore using the same loss that was used during their
pre-training: masked language modeling.

In accordance to the RoBERTa paper, we use dynamic masking rather than static masking. The model may, therefore,
converge slightly slower (over-fitting takes more epochs).

```bash
python run_mlm.py \
    --model_name_or_path roberta-base \
    --dataset_name wikitext \
    --dataset_config_name wikitext-2-raw-v1 \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 8 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size 8 \
    --do_train \
    --do_eval \
    --output_dir /tmp/test-mlm \
    --train_adapter \
    --adapter_config seq_bn \
    --overwrite_output_dir
```

To run on your own training and validation files, use the following command:

```bash
python run_mlm.py \
    --model_name_or_path roberta-base \
    --train_file path_to_train_file \
    --validation_file path_to_validation_file \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 8 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size 8 \
    --do_train \
    --do_eval \
    --output_dir /tmp/test-mlm \
    --train_adapter \
    --adapter_config seq_bn \
    --overwrite_output_dir
```

If your dataset is organized with one sample per line, you can use the `--line_by_line` flag (otherwise the script
concatenates all texts and then splits them in blocks of the same length).

**Note:** On TPU, you should use the flag `--pad_to_max_length` in conjunction with the `--line_by_line` flag to make
sure all your batches have the same length.

### Whole word masking

This part was moved to `examples/research_projects/mlm_wwm`.

### XLNet and permutation language modeling

We have not adapted the permutation language modeling training scripts to use Adapters. To avoid confusion we have not included the non-adapted version in the examples of Adapters.

## Creating a model on the fly

When training a model from scratch, configuration values may be overridden with the help of `--config_overrides`:

```bash
python run_clm.py --model_type gpt2 --tokenizer_name gpt2 \ --config_overrides="n_embd=1024,n_head=16,n_layer=48,n_positions=102" \ --train_adapter \
[...]
```

This feature is only available in `run_clm.py` and `run_mlm.py`.
